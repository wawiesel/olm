# Post-Commit Checklist for AI

## ðŸ¤– AI Rule Compliance Checklist

This checklist appears after every commit to remind the AI to follow project rules for subsequent actions.

### âœ… Before Next Commit:
- [ ] **Check commit standards**: See @development-workflow
- [ ] **Use clean imperative format**: "Add feature X" not "feat: add feature X"  
- [ ] **No prefixes**: Avoid "docs:", "feat:", "fix:", etc.
- [ ] **Keep under 50 characters**: Concise, capitalized, no period
- [ ] **Use imperative verbs**: Add, Fix, Update, Remove, Refactor, etc.

### âœ… Before Creating PR:
- [ ] **Check PR formatting**: See @development-workflow
- [ ] **NO duplicate headers**: Don't repeat title as # header in description
- [ ] **Start with content**: Description begins with summary, not title repetition
- [ ] **Use imperative mood**: "Add feature X" not "Added feature X"
- [ ] **Consider file-based approach**: Use `--body-file description.md` for complex content

### âœ… Before Test Work:
- [ ] **Check testing principles**: See @testing-philosophy
- [ ] **Follow established patterns**: Property-based testing with Hypothesis
- [ ] **Focus on fast tests**: Unit tests for logic, integration for workflows
- [ ] **Target high coverage**: Meaningful tests, not just line coverage

### âœ… General Rule Compliance:
- [ ] **Consult rules proactively**: Reference @ rules before rule-governed actions
- [ ] **State rule being followed**: Explicitly mention which rule guides the action
- [ ] **Ask when uncertain**: Better to ask than violate established patterns
- [ ] **Use git log for dates**: Get actual dates from `git log --date=format:'%B %d, %Y'`

### ðŸŽ¯ Quick Rule Reference:
- **@development-workflow** - Commits, PRs, versioning
- **@testing-philosophy** - Testing approaches and patterns
- **@project-overview** - Project setup and dependencies  
- **@last-session** - Session continuity and context

### ðŸ“‹ Remember:
- **Rules exist for consistency** - Follow them even for small changes
- **Documentation is code** - Session updates and rule compliance matter
- **Git log is truth** - Use actual git history for dates and context
- **Proactive > Reactive** - Check rules before acting, not after violations
